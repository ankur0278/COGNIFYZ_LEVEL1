# LEVEL 1 
Welcome to Level 1 of the Cognifyz Data Science Internship Program. This phase involves initial exploration, preprocessing, and descriptive analysis of the restaurant dataset provided.

# TASK 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
# Objectives:
- Identify the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- Check and handle missing values.
- Perform data type conversions if required.
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable: `Aggregate rating`.

# TASK 2: Descriptive Analysis
# Objectives:
- Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, std) for numerical columns.
- Explore categorical variables like:
  - `Country Code`
  - `City`
  - `Cuisines`
- Identify:
  - Most popular cuisines
  - Cities with the highest number of restaurants

# TASK 3: Geospatial Analysis
# Objectives:
- Visualize restaurant locations using `Latitude` and `Longitude`.
- Analyze distribution of restaurants across cities and countries.
- Identify correlation between location and restaurant rating.

# Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Conclusion
Level 1 focused on laying the foundation for understanding the dataset and preparing it for further analysis. We explored the structure, handled missing data, and derived meaningful insights from basic statistics and geospatial trends.
